X- SectionPage.js is for displaying projects within specific Categories, while ProjectCategoriesPage.js is for displaying only the general categories. The buttons on ProjectCategoriesPage.js will take you to variants of SectionPage.js.X
^ not using this idea right now, each category gets its own page. may come back to this later, though.
- projects no longer need a path since we are now using ids

content organization in the json file:
- projects
    - category
    - title
    - language(s)/tools
    - status
    - short description
    - image(s)/video(s)
        - list of file paths
    - content for page
        - subheadings
        - descriptions
    - link/path

    for each category page, pass in the following data:
    - title
    - desc
    - status
    - id
    - category

    for project subheadings/subjects:
    - Project Description
